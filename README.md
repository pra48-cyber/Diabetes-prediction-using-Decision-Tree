# Diabetes-prediction-using-Decision-Tree
#Overview
This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on medical features. The dataset used is diabetes.csv, which contains relevant health indicators. The model is trained using Scikit-Learn's DecisionTreeClassifier and evaluated using accuracy metrics.

Workflow==
Data Preprocessing,
Load the dataset (diabetes.csv) using Pandas,
Check for missing values and clean the data if necessary,
Split the dataset into features (X) and target (y),
Model Training,

Split data into training and testing sets using train_test_split,
Train a Decision Tree Classifier with a specified max_depth,
Model Evaluation,

Predict outcomes on the test set,
Calculate accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
Visualization,

Plot the Decision Tree using Matplotlib (plot_tree) 
Python
Pandas (Data handling)
Scikit-Learn (Machine learning and evaluation metrics)


Future Enhancements
Optimize hyperparameters (e.g., max_depth, criterion)
Compare Decision Tree with other classifiers like Random Forest or SVM
Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions
